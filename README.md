NutshellEngine Graphics Module using raymarching to draw.

Place ``raymarching.frag`` near NutshellEngine's executable to use and edit it.

``raymarching.frag`` can be edited in real-time and saving the changes will automatically recompile the shader and the pipeline. Compilation errors are written in the console.
